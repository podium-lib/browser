### Working with next releases

When making larger changes that needs thorough testing or modules widely used, you can create a `next` release. Here is how:

1. Create a branch `next` if one does not exist
2. Make changes (or push whatever changes you have on a different branch onto `next`)
3. When you are done, commit your changes with semantic-release in mind
4. The workflows will run and publish a new version on the format: `major.minor.patch-next.<next version>
Where `next version` is incremented each time you push a feat, fix or patch to the branch.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflows:

-   [Build and test pull requests](./.github/workflows/pull-request.yml)
-   [Build and release changes on `main`](./.github/workflows/release.yml)

You'll find the workflow logs and results in the Actions tab.

## On MessageBus

MessageBus uses a global singleton to coordinate message passing between different instances. This is something you need to be aware of, for instance, if writing unit tests. See [MessageBus.test.js](test/MessageBus.test.js) for an example.
